I decided to take this class because I'm a journalism major and at some point I would like to go freelance, so building/designing a website for myself would be a good skill to have!

I'm honestly excited to learn anything and everything. I've never taken a web design or development class, so I'm just trying to figure out how everything works.

The image I decided to upload is a picture of my two dogs who still live back at home with my folks in Washington. I love this photo because it captures both of their personalities perfectly, with one of them beig super hyper and active and the other being sweet and aloof.
